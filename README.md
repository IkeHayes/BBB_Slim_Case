Beaglebone Black Slim Case
==========================
This object is provided open source under the GPL V2 license. I believe in open source and would like anyone who uses this creation to share back their modifications and ideas with the greater online community.

Quick Information
===================
This is a slim line enclosure for the Beaglebone Black. The enclosure is designed to be light weight and as small of a form factor as possible while still giving access to all ports and the pin headers. The model for this case was designed in OpenSCAD and can be freely modified and exported to STL format using that program.

The product page for the Beaglebone Black can be found at the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/black">Beagle Board Website</a>
Information for OpenSCAD can be gound at the <a href="http://openscad.org">OpenSCAD Website</a>

This object is currently released in a fully functional version 1.0 but further development for additional options and accessories is still ongoing. 
Future options that may be developed:
*   Prototyping board that attaches to the case to house breadboards and other components
*   Housing for capes
*   Mountable options to allow mounting of case to external objects.

Hardware Required:
===================

*   Currently none - no bolts or other hardware is required to use this case
*   Future options may require the use of hardware
